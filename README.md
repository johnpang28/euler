Programming Problems
====================

Here are my attempts at solving the problems found at [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/archives)

The solutions are written in Scala. The main objective being for me to practice writing Scala, and coding in the functional style
rather than imperative.

Most solutions are brute force rather than optimal, but will run fairly quickly (< 1 min)
